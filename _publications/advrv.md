# Adversarial Retinal Vessel Segmentation
## Abstract
To improve semantic segmentation efficacy from the perspective of adversarial learning, we propose to perform retinal vessel delineation with adversarial knowledge from discriminator. In specific, the predicted vessel masks are also fed into the discriminator to derive adversarial loss apart from directly computing CE loss. Experiment results show that adversarial learning helps to refine the fine vessel segmentation effectively.
