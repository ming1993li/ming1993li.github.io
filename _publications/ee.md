# Other experience in Electronic Engineering

## Abstract
During undergraduate period, I offered to explore the knowledge in machine intelligence in my spare time. And I designed, made the smart fan, which could adjust 
its speed according to environmental temperature, and smart car, which could track a specific route by using sensingÂ elements. In graduation study, I designed a 
satellite navigation and timing receiver from scratch with high accuracy and robustness and completed my master thesis based on it.
