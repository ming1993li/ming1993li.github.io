# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I am a Senior Research Scientist and Principle Investigator in Guangming Lab, Shenzhen. I am leading a team (about 15 persons) conducting research on AIGC, Multi-modal Large Language Models, 3D Reconstruction, Embodied AI, and Smart Cities. I worked as a research scientist intern at Sea AI Lab and Shanghai AI Lab.

<!-- Full-time researchers, visiting students and remote cooperations are very welcome! -->


* I completed my Ph.D. study (President PhD Fellowship Holder), supervised by [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=DNuiPHwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Fellow of AAAI, ACM, IEEE) and [Prof. Mike Shou](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab), at [Institute of Data Science](https://ids.nus.edu.sg/) of [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). I also work closely with [Prof. Fei Richard Yu](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=zuGMGBoAAAAJ&hl=en) (Member of the Academia Europaea, Fellow of Canadian Academy of Engineering, IEEE), [Prof. Xiangyu Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ec5Biz4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Standford’s Top 2% Most Highly Cited Scientist), [Prof. Huazhu Fu](https://hzfu.github.io),  and [Prof. Jun Liu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/liu-jun).

* Achievements:
  ** Our CVPR 2025 paper, EventGPT, has attracted significant attention from the academic community. Notably, we received collaboration inquiries from famous researchers. The work was also featured by the prominent U.S. AI platform PromptLayer in a special article titled “EventGPT: Giving AI the Power of Superhuman Vision”!
  **

* Academic services: I am a regular reviwer for IEEE TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, AAAI, IEEE TMM, IEEE TIP, IEEE TNNLS, and Neurocomputing.

* I was a visiting scholar in [VISLab](https://zhang-vislab.github.io) supervised by [Prof. Ziming Zhang](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/people/) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) from Nov. 2019 to Apr. 2021. Before that, I worked as a RA supervised by [Prof. Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Fellow of IEEE, AIMBE, IAPR, MICCAI) at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) from Aug. 2018 to Oct. 2019. I graduated with a Master degree from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm) at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn) in Jul. 2018. And I received my Bachelor degree from School of EE of [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm) in Jul. 2015.
