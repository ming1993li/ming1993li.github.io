# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I am a Talented Star Full Prefessor and Principle Investigator in Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (SZ). I am leading a team (about 15 persons) conducting research on AIGC, Multi-modal Large Language Models, 3D Reconstruction, Embodied AI, and Smart Cities. Full-time researchers, visiting students and remote cooperations are very welcome!

* I completed my Ph.D. study (President PhD Fellowship Holder), supervised by [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=DNuiPHwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Mike Shou](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab), at [Institute of Data Science](https://ids.nus.edu.sg/) of [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). I also work closely with [Dr. Xiangyu Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ec5Biz4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Prof. Huazhu Fu](https://hzfu.github.io),  and [Prof. Jun Liu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/liu-jun). My current research interests lie in AIGC (text-to-image/video/3D) and Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). My previous work is about (Privacy-Preserving) Action Recognition, Self-supervised Representation Learning, Person/Vehicle Re-identification and Facial Expression Recognition.

* Internship: I worked as a research scientist intern at Sea AI Lab and Shanghai AI Lab.

* Academic services: I am a regular reviwer for IEEE TPAMI, CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, AAAI, IEEE TMM, IEEE TIP, IEEE TNNLS, and Neurocomputing.

* I was a visiting scholar in [VISLab](https://zhang-vislab.github.io) supervised by [Prof. Ziming Zhang](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/people/) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) from Nov. 2019 to Apr. 2021. Before that, I worked as a RA supervised by [Prof. Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) from Aug. 2018 to Oct. 2019. I graduated with a Master degree from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm) at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn) in Jul. 2018. And I received my Bachelor degree from School of EE of [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm) in Jul. 2015.
