 # I was a visiting scholar in [VISLab](https://zhang-vislab.github.io) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) from Nov. 2019 to Apri. 2021 and my supervisor is [Prof. Ziming Zhang](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/people/). Before that, I worked as a RA at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) from Aug. 2018 to Oct. 2019. My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, especially in person/vehicle re-identification, Multi-Targets-Multi-Cameras (MTMC) tracking and self-supervised visual learning.
