 # I have been a visiting scholar in [VISLab](https://zhang-vislab.github.io) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) from Nov. 2019 and my supervisor is [Prof. Ziming Zhang](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/people/). Before that, I worked as a RA at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) from Aug. 2018 to Oct. 2019. My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, especially in person/vehicle re-identification, Multi-Targets-Multi-Cameras (MTMC) tracking and self-supervised visual learning.

* I have been a visiting scholar in [VISLab](https://zhang-vislab.github.io) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) from Nov. 2019 and my supervisor is [Prof. Ziming Zhang](https://zhang-vislab.github.io/people/). Before that, I worked as a RA at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) from Aug. 2018 to Oct. 2019. My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, especially in person/vehicle re-identification, Multi-Targets-Multi-Cameras (MTMC) tracking and self-supervised visual learning, domain generalization.

* I graduated with a Master degree from [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm) at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn) in July 2018. And I received my Bachelor degree from School of Electric Engineering of [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm) in July 2015. 
 
* My results on [AI City Challenge 2020](https://www.aicitychallenge.org) Track3: City-Scale Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking rank 1st on leaderboard, which surpass second rank by a very large margin!
